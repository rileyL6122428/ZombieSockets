# ZombieSockets

Zombie Sockets is a multiplayer browser game early in development. The game is a
node.js app built on Express. Zombie Sockets uses sockets.io to support real
time, multiplayer play.

The development demo of this game can be found [here][heroku]. The demo
character (an unfilled circle) can be moved by pressing the w,a,s,d keys.
*NOTE* Currently, to start the demo, four users must be on the site at
the same time. For a single visitor, this can be accomplished by opening
four browser windows and signing onto the site.
