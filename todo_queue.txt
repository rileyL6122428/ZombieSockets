Next Steps:
start a character out as a zombie
transfer zombie property on tag
End game when one human remains
add more characters to each session (maybe 8)
Organize multiple games
flesh out extra mechanics, including scoreable mechanics


ZOMBIE Change game plan
if a player is chosen to be a zombie, they instantiate as a new Zombie
if a player is chosen to be a human, they instantiate as a new Human
When caught, the player will be reinstantiated as a zombie
