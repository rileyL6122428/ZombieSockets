URGENT: Remove INTERVAL CB on document unload!
        RE-RENDER ONLY WHEN NECESSARY
        REMOVE UNECESSARY SOCK LISTENERS

RIGHT NOW
  2) refactor code touched so far
  3) setup game purgatory
  4) setup game launch

1) GET DATA TO FRONT END

Next Steps:

Organize multiple games
flesh out extra mechanics, including score able mechanics

Plan for multiple games
Need to create a matchmaking logic file and matchmaking renderer file

For the server side matchmaking
organize multiple games in an array on the server file
organize waiting socks also as an array
let a sock emit certain events from the client side that lets them choose
a game that still has slots available
Once the game fills, a game starts
When a game ends, the game is discarded and the socks can choose to be
re-entered into a new game, or to be sent back to matchmaking (by default,
the sock will be discarded)

for the client side matchmaking
need to render a matchmaking screen
the screen will need to have a ui for picking a game to jump into, along with
info concerning that game's fill status
Once a game is entered, the status of the game filling needs to be updated
on all waiting player screens
